## deep-fake-detection

Given the dramatic increase in deepfakes and GAN generated images and videos, we propose a deep fake detection CNN model that performs very well and is efficient and relatively generalizable as well. We hope to leverage our findings to build the basis for a simpler and more general form of deep fake detection
